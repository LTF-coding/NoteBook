*Human Motion Generation: A Survey*
**Scope** of this papar: 
+ the generation of human motion based on given conditional signals.
+ without human motion completion (e.g., motion prediction, motion interpolation), human motion editing (e.g. motion retargeting, motion style transfer)

*Deep learning-based motion style transfer tools, techniques and future challenges* (motion style transfer)
*A survey on deep learning for skeleton-based human animation* (human motion using physical simulation environments (e.g., character control, locomotion))

### Profile
**Main Aims:** 
Generate natural human pose sequences. (natural, smooth, plausibility)
**Challenges:** 
1. **The intricate nature of human motion.**
   + highly non-linear and articulated
   + subject to physical and bio-mechanical constraints
   + specialized neural mechanisms for perceiving biological motion
2. **The implicit relationship with conditional signals.**
   + harmonious with the conditional signal
   + serves as an essential nonverbal communication medium, reflecting various underlying factors
   + capture subtle variations and the semantic connection with the conditional signals

**Mainstream Sub-tasks**: text-conditioned, audio-conditioned, and scene-conditioned
**Appications:** film production, video games, AR/VR, human-robot interaction, and digital humans

### Key Concepts
+ Humans plan and execute body motions based on their intention and the environmental stimulus.
  人体动作主要基于人的主观意识和环境刺激。
+ Human brains possess specialized neural mechanisms for perceiving biological motion and are sensitive to even slightly unnatural kinematics.
  人的大脑具有感知生物运动的专门神经机制，甚至对略微不自然的运动敏感。
